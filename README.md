## MVA Projects

This repo contains all the relevant projects I performed during my year at MVA master. MVA (Mathematics, Vision, Learning)
is one of Europe's most renowned master on the broad field of Machine Learning. A substantial part of the courses
is validated by a project on a recent research paper.
