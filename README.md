## MVA Projects

This repository contains all the projects I carried out, at least in part, during my year at [MVA master's program](https://www.master-mva.com/). MVA (Mathematics, Vision, Learning)
is one of Europe's most renowned master on the broad field of Machine Learning. 

Indeed, a substantial part of the courses is validated by a project on a recent research paper.
