This repository contains the project for the Course **Robotics** of Aymeric Caron at MVA, done in collaboration with Charles-Andr√© Kieffer. 
It deals with the making of a control law for a biped robot, a very common problem in robotics engineering, and not as difficult as it could appear first.
It is based on the papers: 
[Trajectory Free Linear Model Predictive Control for Stable Walking in the Presence of Strong Perturbations.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4115592), 

[ Biped Walking Pattern Generation by using Preview Control of Zero-Moment Point](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4041375_Biped_walking_pattern_generation_by_using_preview_control_of_zero-moment_point)

and [Online Walking Motion Generation with Automatic Foot Step Placement](https://inria.hal.science/inria-00391408v1/document).

You can find here the code and the final seminar poster.
