# Generative Modelling for Images

This repo stores all my work on the class Generative Modelling for Images. You can find all the labs provided by Arthur Leclaire and 
Bruno Galerne during the course for self-evaluation and training.

Also, you can find my work on the coursework on the generation of MNIST by a special kind of 
GAN adapted to solve the semi-discrete formulation of Optimal Transport.

Finally, you can find an implementation of the algorithm described in the paper [ PseudoInverse-Guided Diffusion Models for Inverse Problems](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=9_gsMA8MRKQ) to solve 
inverse problems (linear and non-linear!) with a known degradation operator.
