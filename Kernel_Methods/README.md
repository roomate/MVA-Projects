# Kernel-Methods-for-ML-Kaggle-challenge
This challenge, carried out as part of the "kernel methods for machine learning" course of the Msc MVA, involves the implementation of an image classification model based solely on kernel methods. 

### Decription of the dataset
The dataset is composed of 5000 images of 32x32 pixels represented as a vector of size 3072 such that the first 1024 values represent pixel intensities on the red channel, the next 1024 columns represent the green channel and the last 1024 columns the blue channel.
Each image is associated with a label from 0 to 9 such that the total number of classes is 10.
### An example of an image

This project is the perfect occasion to implement and test classical kernel methods on actual data.
