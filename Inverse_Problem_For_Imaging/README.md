# Greens function estimation from ambient noise signals with limited illumination in 3D



A classical set up in inverse problems for imaging is the following one. Given a medium, a set of sensors and sources at known locations, 
what information on the medium can we retrieve from it (presence of obstacle(s), sound's celerity...) ?

In particular, this work is concerned with the measure of the sound's velocity in an unknown homogeneous medium, is of paramount importance in practice. 
The originality here comes from using ambient noise signals, therefore, not only is there no operator source and only sensors, but randomness comes into play. 
This way of proceeding can look counter intuitive at first, but with the tools of correlation and a bit of intelligence, we can carry it off.
