# Greens function estimation from ambient noise signals with limited illumination in 3D


A classical set up in inverse problems for imaging is the following one. Given a medium, a set of sensors and sources at known locations surrounding it, 
what information can we retrieve from the propagation of a wave (presence of obstacle(s), sound's celerity...) ? In practice, each sources emit a harmonic wave propagating through
the medium, afterwards received by the sensors. The analysis of these data can be quite informative on the medium's property.
This problematic is of paramount importance in practice, whether in the medical, nuclear or civil engineering sector.

In particular, our work is concerned with the measure of the sound's velocity in an unknown homogeneous medium. 
The originality here comes from using ambient noise signals, therefore, not only is there no source (only sensors), but randomness comes into play. 
This way of proceeding can look counter intuitive at first, but with the tools of correlation and a bit of intelligence, we can carry it off.
